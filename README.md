>🌸 I'm an enthusiastic beginner coder, ready to explore and uncover the wonders of coding ⭐

As of now, I am studying Creative Computing Bsc, which covers areas of programming, <br>animation, design, and more.
<br>
<br>
Empowered by this knowledge, I aim to create projects in the future that strengthen my desire for coding.
<br>
#### 📃 My Cozy Space ☔☕
I use Github as my safe space, to openely code, enjoy a cup of coffee, explore books, and weave tales– developers are authors too. 💻📚
